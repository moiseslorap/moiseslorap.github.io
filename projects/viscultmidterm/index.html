          <h3>Poverty</h3>
          <p>Often in media, only the bright side of the Dominican Republic is portrayed. The beautiful beaches, luxurious resorts and magnificent landscapes are shown, yet
            the true side is never shown. How almost a third (30.5% exactly) of the population is below the poverty line and over 20% are on extreme poverty.

        <div class="large-6 columns" style="padding-left:5em;">
          <h3>Hardwork</h3>
          <p>The Dominican culture is sometimes portrayed as laidback, as in the type where all men do is play dominoes and drink beers at the bodega. What is not shown
            is the dominicans are hardworkers and strive for their goals.

          <h3>Education</h3>
          <p>Although the Dominican Republic is not recognized for having the highest education index, the country implements a strict and rich curriculum. Ranging from
            teaching 3 languages (Spanish, English and French) to providing the option to obtain a technical degree in a specified area, our educational programs have a lot to offer.
            This is evidenced by the high influx of professionals everyday reaching higher goals.

          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="large-6 columns" style="padding-left:5em;">
          <h3>Technology</h3>
          <p>I've often heard from friends teasing me "Does your country even have roads??", and although this is true in some very poor areas, the Dominican Republic is one of the most technologically advanced countries on Latin America. 
            This is evidenced by being one of the few countries with a Subway system, first country to implement both 4G LTE and fiber optics for internet connectivity, digital radio, etc. Even our president's speeches are broadcasted in High Definition.

        <div class="large-6 columns" style="padding-left:5em;">
          <h3>Sports</h3>
          <p>The Dominican Republic is famously known for being the second largest producer of professional baseball players, and even though this isn't an inaccurate portrayal by the media, a lot is left untold about this subject. Dominican
            Culture is heavy in sports, especially baseball. The sport is played everywhere throughout the country. But what to do when there is no baseball field nearby, easy, play a classic game of "vitilla", a game that consists of hitting a water gallon cap
            with a broom stick. Dominican professional players attribute their batting skills to this game due to the high difficulty of hitting the cap.

        <p>I decided to do this topic because I wanted to look at how my country is represented in media. It was very satisfying being able to give my opinion on certain portrayals the media often does. 
          Whether it was in agreement or denial, it was a fulfilling experience being able to apply my cultural knowledge after being born and raised in the Dominican Republic and providing my own point of view. 
        </p>
        <p>From my perspective, how a country is portrayed by the Media is highly important, and it is essential to analyze this. To look at both sides is crucial and to assess whether the media's portrayal of it is an actual representation of the country's culture. </p>
        <p>In my opinion, the media's portrayal of the Dominican Republic will continue to trend in a positive direction as time progresses. Media is becoming more aware of all of the country's advancements and getting a more accurate depction of our
           culture, and it is something I expect to change positively in the next few years.
